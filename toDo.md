# Stuff I need to do in my computing coursework

Here is a small list of improvements or features that I need to add to my program. Bugs will also be listed here so I know what I have to fix:

* Check to see what is in the database after edit is made, as it seem to alter the entry one too low.
* Add checking to ensure that the user has selected a box when they click edit entry, maybe with try/execpt.
* Add a search function, with a bar which can be entered into (QLineEdit), then click a button or press enter to commence the search. This should probably be handed by an optional parameter passed into the "updateTable" routine, like a "WHERE" SQL statement.
